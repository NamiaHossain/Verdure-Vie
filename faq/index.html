      <h4>What types of plants do you offer? </h4>
      <p>Finding the ideal plant for your space involves considering a few key factors:

        Light Conditions:
        
        Bright & Direct Light: Ideal for succulents, cacti, spider plants, and some flowering varieties.
        Medium & Indirect Light: Perfect for Monstera deliciosa (Swiss cheese plant), Philodendron, Fiddle Leaf Fig, and many popular houseplants.
        Low Light: Ferns, Snake Plants, ZZ Plants, and Chinese Evergreens thrive in shady corners.
        Space Availability:
        
        Floor Plants: Ideal for filling empty corners, consider Fiddle Leaf Figs, Ficus Benjamina, or large Monsteras.
        Tabletop Plants: Perfect for desks, shelves, or windowsills, explore Pothos varieties, African Violets, or Air Plants.
        Hanging Plants: Liven up empty spaces with Spider Plants, String of Pearls, or Philodendrons in hanging planters.
        Humidity:
        
        Average Humidity: Most houseplants thrive in standard home humidity levels.
        High Humidity: Group plants together to create a mini-humid environment for Calatheas, Ferns, or Peace Lilies.
        Your Lifestyle:
        
        Beginner-Friendly: Opt for low-maintenance plants like Snake Plants, ZZ Plants, or Sansevieria varieties.
        Frequent Traveler: Consider succulents, cacti, or air plants that require less frequent watering.</p>

      <h4>What are some beginner-friendly plants?</h4>
      <p>At Verdure Vie, we understand that not everyone has a black belt in botany! Here are some fantastic beginner-friendly plants that are easy to care for and will thrive in most homes:

        Low-Maintenance Champions:
        
        Snake Plant (Sansevieria): Nearly indestructible, tolerates low light and infrequent watering.
        ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia): Known for its glossy, dark green foliage, thrives in neglect and low light.
        Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum): Produces cascading baby spiderettes, enjoys indirect light and moderate watering.
        Pothos (Epipremnum aureum): Available in various colors and patterns, tolerates low light and enjoys occasional watering.
        Cast Iron Plant (Aspidistra elatior): Lives up to its name, tolerates low light, infrequent watering, and even neglect.
        Beyond the Basics:
        
        Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata): A popular choice with stunning large leaves, thrives in bright indirect light and consistent watering. (Note: Requires slightly more attention than the previous options)
        Monstera Deliciosa (Swiss Cheese Plant): A trendy plant with unique foliage, enjoys bright indirect light and moderate watering. (Note: May require occasional moss pole support for climbing.)
        Air Plants (Tillandsia spp.): Don't need soil! Soak them in water periodically and provide bright indirect light.</p>
